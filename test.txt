Winter is the   of the year in  and ; it does not occur in most of the . It occurs after  and before  in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that  being oriented away from the . Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.  When it is winter in the , it is  in the , and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with  and  temperatures. The moment of  is when the 's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the  is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole).  The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with  increasing and  decreasing as the  progresses after the . The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the  regions differ from the date of the , however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see ).
The English word winter comes from the  noun *wintru-, whose origin is unclear. Several proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the  root *wed- 'water' or a nasal infix variant *wend-.
The tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44° to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the  as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about s. When it is winter in the , the  faces the  more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the . Conversely, winter in the  occurs when the  is tilted more toward the . From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter  has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the  .
During winter in either , the lower altitude of the  causes the sunlight to hit the Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of  strikes the Earth per unit of surface area. Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the distance of the Earth from the  (due to the Earth's elliptical orbit) is negligible.
The manifestation of the meteorological winter ( temperatures) in the northerly –prone latitudes is highly variable depending on elevation, position versus marine winds and the amount of . For instance, within  (a country of cold winters),  on the , a long way from the ocean, has a January high of −11.3 °C (11.7 °F) and a low of −21.4 °C (−6.5 °F). In comparison,  on the west coast with a marine influence from moderating Pacific winds has a January low of 1.4 °C (34.5 °F) with days well above  at 6.9 °C (44.4 °F). Both places are at 49°N latitude, and in the same western half of the continent. A similar but less extreme effect is found in Europe: in spite of their northerly latitude, the British Isles have not a single non-mountain weather station with a below- mean January temperature.
Meteorological reckoning is the method of measuring the winter  used by  based on "sensible weather patterns" for record keeping purposes, so the start of meteorological winter varies with latitude. Winter is often defined by  to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. This corresponds to the months of December, January and February in the , and June, July and August in the . The  average temperatures of the  are typically experienced in January or February in the  and in June, July or August in the . Nighttime predominates in the winter , and in some regions winter has the highest rate of  as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent  cover or high  rates coupled with low temperatures, precluding evaporation.  often develop and cause many transportation delays. , also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching −40 °C (−40 °F) due to air with slightly higher moisture from above mixing with colder, surface-based air. They are made of simple hexagonal ice crystals. The  (SMHI) defines thermal winter as when the daily mean temperatures are below 0 °C (32 °F) for five consecutive days. According to the SMHI, winter in Scandinavia is more pronounced when Atlantic low-pressure systems take more southerly and northerly routes, leaving the path open for high-pressure systems to come in and cold temperatures to occur. As a result, the  January on record in , in 1987, was also the sunniest.
Accumulations of  and ice are commonly associated with winter in the , due to the large land masses there. In the , the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40°S makes the winters milder; thus,  and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the . In this region,  occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly  region of South Argentina. Snow occurs year-round in .
In the , some authorities define the period of winter based on astronomical fixed points (i.e. based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the ), regardless of weather conditions. In one version of this definition, winter begins at the  and ends at the . These dates are somewhat later than those used to define the beginning and end of the meteorological winter – usually considered to span the entirety of December, January, and February in the  and June, July, and August in the Southern.
Astronomically, the , being the day of the year which has fewest hours of daylight, ought to be in the middle of the , but al lag means that the  period normally follows the  by a few weeks. In some cultures, the  is regarded as beginning at the  and ending on the following  – in the , depending on the year, this corresponds to the period between 20, 21 or 22 December and 19, 20 or 21 March.
In the United Kingdom,  consider winter to be the three  months of December, January and February. In Scandinavia, winter in one tradition begins on 14 October and ends on the last day of February. In , calendar winter is widely regarded to start on 1 December and end on 28 February. In many countries in the , including Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, winter begins on 1 June and ends on 31 August. In  such as Ireland (using the ) and in Scandinavia, the  is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter  beginning 1 November, on , or . Winter ends and  begins on , or , which is 1 or 2 February. This system of s is based on the length of days exclusively. (The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest  occurs during November, December and January in the  and May, June and July in the .)
Also, many mainland European countries tended to recognize  or  (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter. The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian  and  dates. Also,  (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of , such as flowers blooming.
In  and other East Asian , winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, with the  (known as 立冬 lì dōng – literally, "establishment of winter").
The three-month period associated with the  average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the  and lasts through late February or early March. This "thermological winter" is earlier than the  delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic) definition. Depending on al lag, this period will vary between climatic regions.
Cultural influences such as  may have led to the winter  being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years, although high latitude countries like  are usually well into their real winters before the December .
Since by almost all definitions valid for the , winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the  is split across years, just like  in the . Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. "Winter 2018". Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. "Winter 18/19", or settling on the year the  starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions.
Ecological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates.  It is one of six s recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term hibernal for this period of the year (the other ecological s being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and al).  The hibernal  coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in  of the Earth.  The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal  as early as late January in mild temperate climates.
To survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for :
Some  never survive the winter. Other  require winter cold to complete their life cycle; this is known as . As for , many small ones profit from the insulating effects of  by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly , usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the  layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the , which flowers in time for . The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called .
Humans are sensitive to cold, see . , , al depression. Slipping on black ice and falling  are other health concerns associated with cold and y weather. In the , it is not unusual for homeless people to die from  in the winter.
One of the most common diseases associated with winter is .
In , the  is called  (meaning: birth) and it has been celebrated for thousands of years. It is referred to as the eve of the birth of , who symbolised light, goodness and strength on earth.
In ,  kidnapped  to be his wife.  ordered  to return her to , the goddess of the Earth and her mother. However,  tricked  into eating the food of the dead, so  decreed that  would spend six months with  and six months with . During the time her daughter is with ,  became depressed and caused winter.
In ,  abducted a maiden named . On May Day, her lover, , fought Gwyn to win her back. The battle between them represented the contest between  and winter.
